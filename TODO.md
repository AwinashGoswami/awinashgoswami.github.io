# TODO: Fix Tab Functionality in Portfolio Website

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Update the Bootstrap CSS link in index.html to use Bootstrap 5 CDN for consistency with the HTML and JS.
- [x] Remove the Bootstrap 4 JavaScript script from index.html to avoid conflicts with Bootstrap 5.
- [x] Test the tab functionality by launching the website in a browser and clicking on tabs like "facebook-tab" to ensure content switches properly.

## Notes:
- The issue was caused by loading both Bootstrap 4 and 5 scripts, leading to conflicts.
- After changes, the tabs should work as expected.
